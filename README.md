My Milestone Project 4 presents a website where a visitor can buy products related to horses and horseriding.

Here's a link to the live app:

This website is for people who have horses as a hobby or work with it and want to buy some horse-related products. The website has products like riding clothes, 
riders gear (such as helmets, body protectors), grooming kit, medical care, saddles, bridles, bits etc. Everything a horse person needs!

[Hööks](https://www.hookseurope.com/) has been the focal point in this project. Their website looks clean and is easy to navigate 
and has been an inspiration for me.
They also have the green colour, but actually, I had planned the green colour scheme before I visited their site.  

The business goals of this website are:    
* Showcase the products available for purchase  
* Make the visitor/shopper return to the site
* Make the shopper "shop till they drop"   

The user goals of this website are:    
* Search and view the products     
* Add your own profile
* View product ratings and rate oneself
